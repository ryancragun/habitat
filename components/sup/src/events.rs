//! Main interface for a stream of events the Supervisor can send out
//! in the course of its operations.
//!
//! Currently, the Supervisor is able to send events to a [NATS
//! Streaming][1] server. The `init_stream` function must be called
//! before sending events to initialize the publishing thread in the
//! background. Thereafter, you can pass "event" structs to the
//! `event` function, which will publish the event to the stream.
//!
//! All events are published under the "habitat" subject.
